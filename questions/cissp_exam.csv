0b5bc948-2d88-4e51-9cb2-109c578eaf8a,An outer-control loop,What is needed when a system’s feedback loop and a logic model require an additional layer of due diligence?,"Due diligence is the measuring, the calculating, and the pre-decision aspect of governance, and is demonstrated by using cybernetics as an example.  A feedback loop measures the state of the system, whereas logic models make the decisions.  The outer control loop is part of the hierarchy of the feedback loop’s process control and demonstrates due diligence.  Logic bomb is a type of malware, and silicon root of trust is firmware technology that integrates security into the hardware level of a chip.  This is a Domain 1 question.",
f14e1a63-e219-41fa-8eab-c2afa62fd730,"Check KGIs related to changing the security baseline, and if it takes less time to change the baseline, submit a request to change the baseline.","A number of key goal indicators (KGI) show that it takes an average of four months to successfully implement a change through the change management process. If you are facing a non-urgent but much needed change, the absence of which could create additional risks, what is the best approach to recommend?","This question presents “TMI” (too much information), and might be similar to a beta question, however it requires you to apply practical working knowledge to the concepts of secure baseline and change management. If you struggled with this question be sure to read up on both secure baseline and change management in Domain 7.",

What is the best advice if there is no legal team to respond to this request?,"At times you’ll be presented with questions that have too much information.  In these cases, you’ll have to identify the irrelevant pieces of information and try to rule out options one-by-one based on how their wording aligns (or doesn’t align) with the context of the question.  In this case, you will need to know a little bit about the GDPR and what’s discussed in the CBK.\n If you’re familiar with GDPR, its scope seems to be changing as court cases and legal matters come up, but for the most part its scope ends if the citizen doesn’t reside in a participating country.  There are also jurisdiction concerns if the company is not part of the EU.  This is a Domain 1 question.\n The CBK specifically mentions some concerns with the GDPR “right to be forgotten” clause, but even if you’re not 100% familiar with it, you might still be able to answer the question.  You can ignore certain pieces of information, such as the fact that there is no legal team.  You can ignore the issue about whether the individual/company resides in the EU after examining the question in its entirety, because there is no blanket application of this particular clause, and the other details are more important in this scenario.\n Pay special attention to the wording of all questions, as a single question could be the deciding factor of a pass/fail score.  In this case, the word “requires” should stand out.  The CBK specifically talks about defamation lawsuits being some type of exemption from the deletion of data (as evidence/artifact rules would apply at that point).",
